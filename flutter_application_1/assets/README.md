# Assets Folder

Please add the following files to make the app fully functional:

## Audio Files (assets/audio/)
1. **riva_reply_1.mp3** - A generic "Okay, I'm on it." audio file
2. **elevenlabs_mock.mp3** - A mock "cloned voice" file

You can record these yourself or use any royalty-free audio files.

## Image Files (assets/images/)
1. **john_avatar.png** - A fake avatar image

You can use any avatar image or download one from avatar generators online.

## Temporary Note
The app will work without these files, but audio playback won't function until you add the .mp3 files.
